NAME
    MooseX::RelatedClasses::Aliased - sugar for MooseX::RelatedClasses

SYNOPSIS
    Example from MooseX::RelatedClasses...

       package My::Framework;
       use Moose;
       use namespace::autoclean;
       with 'MooseX::RelatedClasses' => {
          name => 'Thinger',
       };

    Later on you'd do this:

       sub my_method {
          my $self    = shift;
          my $thinger = $self->thinger_class->new(...);
          ...;
       }

    Using this module...

       package My::Framework;
       use Moose;
       use namespace::autoclean;
       use MooseX::RelatedClasses::Aliased => {
          name => 'Thinger',
       };

    And:

       sub my_method {
          my $self    = shift;
          my $thinger = Thinger->new(...);
          ...;
       }

DESCRIPTION
    This is the spawn on MooseX::RelatedClasses and aliased. It's cute, but
    it relies on some pretty dodgy stuff under the hood.

    This idea doesn't work very well with inheritance right now.
